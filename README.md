### Requirements analysis is an important aspect of project management here the project is a coffee pouring robot, and i will identifying its functional and non functional requirements from different Perspectives like in mecanic,iot,ai,electonics..


| Perspective   | functional requirements                                                                  | non functional requirements                        |
|:------------  |:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:| --------------------------------------------------:|
|iot            |webpage to control robot movement such as (stop,start,right,left,forward,backward)        |the type of data to be stored in database           |
|iot            |check if data come from sensor need to take some action                                   |the type of device to display the webpage           |
|iot            |send data come from sensors to database                                                   |the speed of internet in device that has the webpage|
|ai             |how the robot draw and save its map in ros os                                             |How long will the robot keep a map of a previous place it visited? 
|mecanic        |balance when robot doing coffee pouring                                                   |The type of material that covers the robot's hand  |
|electonics     |control the pouring in specific time                                                      |-     |                                                  |electonics     |pouring the coffee quantity the occasion with the cup                                     |is made of heat-resistant material to avoid accident|
